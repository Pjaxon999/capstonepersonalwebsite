    <h2>Some of the places I have been</h2>
    <div class="content">
        <div class="location" id="california">
            <h3>California</h3>
            <img src="../assets/images/california.JPG">
            <p>A place I have been to several times with both my family and my partner. Every time I go I am thankful I don't live there, but always appreciate the climate and amenities.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="location" id="spain">
            <h3>Spain</h3>
            <img src="../assets/images/spain.jpg">
            <p>Spain was my first real trip that I took by myself and as a result it has a special place in my heart. I loved both northern and southern Spain, and wish to return one day.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="location" id="costarica">
            <h3>Costa Rica</h3>
            <img src="../assets/images/costarica.jpg">
            <p>Costa Rica was a similar trip to Spain in that I was by myself. We spent a lot of time hiking in the hills and in boats along the rivers. Costa Rica is truly a magical place.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="location" id="england">
            <h3>England</h3>
            <img src="../assets/images/england.JPG">
            <p>I was born in England and lived there for 8 years. Although it may be cheating to say going there is an adventure, it will always feel like one because in many ways it is so alien to me.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="location" id="japan">
            <h3>Japan</h3>
            <img src="../assets/images/japan.jpg">
            <p>Japan had always been a bucket list travel destination for me, so when my father offered to take me to Tokyo, I couldn't say no. I wish to return to explore more of the islands some day.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="location" id="sanddunes">
            <h3>The Sand Dunes</h3>
            <img src="../assets/images/sanddunes.JPG">
            <p>I have gone on many small motorcyle trips within my State of Colorado, but the Great Sand Dunes will always stick out to me for feeling like a foreign place has been dumped right in the middle of our state.</p>
